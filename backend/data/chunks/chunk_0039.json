Write a launch file that starts both nodes and remaps the topic they use to communicate. Run the launch file and verify that the nodes are communicating correctly.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have the skills to take your robotics applications out of the lab and into the real world. You can package, deploy, and maintain your ROS 2 systems on real robots.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Create a ROS 2 package for a simple application.</li> <li>Write a launch file that starts multiple nodes with remapped topics.</li> <li>Use ros2 bag to record and replay data from a running ROS 2 system.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
