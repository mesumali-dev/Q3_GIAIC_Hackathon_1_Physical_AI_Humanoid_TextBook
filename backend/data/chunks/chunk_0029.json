What mode of interaction would be most appropriate for this task? What are the potential safety concerns?</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have an appreciation for the human-centered aspects of robotics. You can think critically about how to design robots that are not only functional but also safe and easy for people to use.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Define Human-Robot Interaction.</li> <li>List three different ways a human can interact with a robot.</li> <li>Describe a potential safety hazard in a human-robot collaborative task.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
