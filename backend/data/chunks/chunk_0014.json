In ROS 2, this is typically done by running a teleoperation node that reads input from a keyboard, joystick, or other device and publishes velocity commands to a topic. The standard topic for velocity commands is /cmdvel, and the message type is geometrymsgs/msg/Twist. A Twist message contains two vectors: linear (for x, y, z velocity) and angular (for roll, pitch, yaw velocity). Simple Autonomous Movement To make a robot move on its own, you can write a ROS 2 node that publishes Twist messages to the /cmd_vel topic. By controlling the linear and angular velocities over time, you can make the robot follow a specific path. For example, to make a robot drive in a straight line, you would publish a Twist message with a constant positive linear.x value and zero for all other values. To make it turn, you would publish a message with a positive or negative angular.z value. <Checkpoint> <p>What is the name and message type of the standard ROS 2 topic for robot velocity commands?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Write a ROS 2 Python node that makes your simulated robot drive in a circle. You will need to publish a Twist message with a constant linear.x and a constant angular.z.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You can now make a robot move! This is a fundamental skill that you will build upon in the coming chapters.</",
