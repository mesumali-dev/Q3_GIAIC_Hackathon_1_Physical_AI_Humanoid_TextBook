This is often framed as a \"next-best-view\" problem, where the robot must decide where to go next to see the most new territory. <Checkpoint> <p>What is the main advantage of a decentralized approach to multi-robot coordination?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Read about the different exploration algorithms available in the Nav2 stack. Choose one of the algorithms and run it in a simulated environment. Observe how the robot chooses its path to explore the unknown space.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You are now aware of some of the most challenging and interesting research problems in robot navigation. These are the areas where the next generation of robotics breakthroughs will happen.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Describe a challenge of long-term robot operation.</li> <li>Explain the difference between centralized and decentralized multi-robot coordination.</li> <li>Define the goal of an exploration algorithm.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
