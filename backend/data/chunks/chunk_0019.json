Configure the gazeboroscamera plugin to publish images to a ROS 2 topic. Use RViz2 to visualize the camera feed.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>Your simulated robot can now \"see\" the world! This is the first step towards building autonomous robots that can perceive and react to their environment.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Add a camera to a URDF and view the image feed in RViz2.</li> <li>Add a LiDAR sensor and visualize the point cloud data.</li> <li>Explain the role of a Gazebo sensor plugin.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
