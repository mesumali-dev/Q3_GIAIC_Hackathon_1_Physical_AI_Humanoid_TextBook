These plugins generate sensor data based on the state of the simulated world and publish it to ROS 2 topics. To add a sensor to your robot, you need to add a <sensor> block to your URDF or SDF file and configure the appropriate plugin. Camera A camera sensor simulates a real-world camera, publishing images to a ROS 2 topic. You can configure the camera's resolution, frame rate, and other parameters. The gazeboroscamera plugin is commonly used for this. LiDAR A LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor measures distances by emitting laser beams. In Gazebo, a LiDAR sensor plugin simulates this by casting rays into the environment and calculating the distances to objects. The data is typically published as a sensormsgs/msg/LaserScan or sensormsgs/msg/PointCloud2 message. IMU An IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measures a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. A Gazebo IMU plugin simulates the readings of a real IMU, often with configurable noise models to make the simulation more realistic. <Checkpoint> <p>What is the role of a Gazebo plugin in sensor simulation?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Add a camera sensor to the front of your simulated robot's chassis. Configure the gazeboroscamera plugin to publish images",
