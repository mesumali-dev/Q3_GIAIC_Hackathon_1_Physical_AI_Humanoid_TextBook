Long-term autonomy is concerned with enabling robots to operate for days, weeks, or even months without human intervention. This introduces a new set of challenges, including: - Life-long mapping: How can a robot update its map as the environment changes over time? - Localization recovery: How can a robot recover its position if it gets lost? - Battery management: How can a robot ensure that it always has enough power to complete its tasks and return to a charging station? Multi-Robot Coordination For tasks that are too large or complex for a single robot, a team of robots can be used. Multi-robot coordination is the problem of getting a team of robots to work together effectively. There are two main approaches: - Centralized: A central server makes all the decisions for the team. This is simple to implement but can be a single point of failure. - Decentralized: Each robot makes its own decisions based on local information and communication with its neighbors. This is more robust but can be more difficult to design and analyze. Exploration Exploration is the task of autonomously exploring an unknown environment to build a map. The goal is to choose a sequence of actions that will reveal the most information about the environment in the least amount of time. This is often framed as a \"next-best-view\" problem, where the robot must decide where to go next to see the most new territory. <Checkpoint> <p>What is the main advantage of a decentralized approach to multi-robot coordination?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Read",
