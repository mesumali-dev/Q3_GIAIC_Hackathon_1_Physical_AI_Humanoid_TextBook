However, a policy that works perfectly in simulation may fail completely when deployed on a real robot. This is because no simulator is a perfect model of reality. The differences between the simulation and the real world are known as the reality gap. The reality gap can be caused by many factors, including: - Inaccurate physics models (e.g., friction, mass, elasticity). - Imperfect sensor models (e.g., noise, biases, lighting conditions). - Differences in timing and latency. Domain Randomization Domain randomization is a technique that aims to bridge the reality gap by making the simulated environment so varied that the real world looks like just another variation. Instead of training the agent in a single, highly realistic simulation, we train it in a large number of simulations with randomized parameters (e.g., different lighting, textures, friction, mass). This forces the agent to learn a policy that is robust to variations in the environment and is more likely to transfer to the real world. System Identification System identification is an alternative approach to Sim2Real. Instead of making the simulation more varied, system identification aims to make the simulation more accurate. It involves running experiments on the real robot to measure its physical properties (e.g., mass, friction, motor constants) and then using these measurements to create a more realistic simulation model. <Checkpoint>",
