A simulator like Gazebo provides a virtual environment where you can safely and rapidly test your robot's software. Gazebo simulates physics, sensors, and actuators, allowing you to develop your code as if it were running on a real robot. The Gazebo World A Gazebo simulation takes place in a world, which is defined in an SDF file. The world file specifies the environment, including: - Models: Robots, furniture, and other objects. - Physics: Gravity, friction, and other physical properties. - Lighting: Light sources to illuminate the scene. - Sensors: Simulated cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, etc. Interfacing with ROS 2 Gazebo integrates seamlessly with ROS 2 through a set of plugins. These plugins expose the simulator's functionality through standard ROS 2 topics, services, and actions. For example, you can control a simulated robot's joints by publishing messages to a ROS 2 topic, and you can receive simulated sensor data from another topic. <Checkpoint> <p>What is a \"world\" file in Gazebo, and what does it typically define?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Launch an empty Gazebo world. Use the Gazebo GUI to add simple shapes (like a box and a sphere) to the world. Apply different materials and colors to them.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome",
