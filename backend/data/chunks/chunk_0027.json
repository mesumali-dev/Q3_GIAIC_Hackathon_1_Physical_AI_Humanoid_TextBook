Experiment with different hyperparameters (like the learning rate and discount factor) and observe how they affect the agent's performance.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have a foundational understanding of how reinforcement learning can be used to train intelligent agents. You are ready to explore how these techniques can be applied to more complex robotics problems.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Define the five core components of an RL problem.</li> <li>Explain the purpose of a reward function.</li> <li>Describe a robotics problem that could be solved using RL.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
