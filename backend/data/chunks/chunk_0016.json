Mapping: \"What does the world look like?\" 2. Localization: \"Where am I in the world?\" 3. Path Planning: \"How do I get to my destination?\" SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) In many real-world scenarios, a robot starts in an unknown environment. It doesn't have a map, and it doesn't know its location. SLAM is a set of algorithms that allows a robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously tracking its own position within that map. This is a classic \"chicken and egg\" problem in robotics, and it is fundamental to autonomous navigation. The Nav2 Stack Nav2 is the official navigation stack in ROS 2. It is a powerful and flexible system that provides a complete solution for autonomous navigation. Nav2 takes in sensor data, a map, and a goal, and it outputs velocity commands to move the robot to the goal while avoiding obstacles. Key components of Nav2 include: - Costmaps: Representations of the environment where each cell has a value corresponding to its \"cost\" to travel through. Obstacles have a high cost. - Planners: Algorithms that find a path from the robot's current position to the goal. - Controllers: Algorithms that follow the planned path while reacting to immediate obstacles. <Checkpoint> <p>Why is",
