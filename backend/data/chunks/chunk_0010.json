Before we can simulate or control a robot, we need a way to describe its physical properties to the software. A robot model defines the robot's structure, including its links, joints, sensors, and visual appearance. URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) URDF is an XML-based format used in ROS to describe the kinematics and dynamics of a robot. It represents the robot as a tree of links connected by joints. - Links: These are the rigid parts of the robot (e.g., the chassis, a wheel, an arm segment). - Joints: These define the motion between links. Common joint types include revolute (for rotating joints), continuous (for wheels), and prismatic (for sliding joints). SDF (Simulation Description Format) SDF is another XML-based format, primarily used by the Gazebo simulator. While URDF is great for describing the kinematics of a single robot, SDF is a more comprehensive format that can describe an entire simulation world, including multiple robots, lighting, physics, and sensors. <Checkpoint> <p>When would you choose to use SDF over URDF?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Create a simple URDF file for a robot with a single arm that rotates at the shoulder. Use the check_urdf tool to verify your file, and then visualize it in RViz2.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You can now create basic representations of robots for use in ROS and Gazebo.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul>",
