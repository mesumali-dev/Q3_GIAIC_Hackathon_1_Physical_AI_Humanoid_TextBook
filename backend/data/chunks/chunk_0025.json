  "content_raw": "to move from its current configuration to a goal configuration. - 3D Perception: Using sensor data to build a representation of the environment for collision avoidance. <Checkpoint> <p>Why is Inverse Kinematics considered a \"hard\" problem compared to Forward Kinematics?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Work through the MoveIt tutorials. Launch the MoveIt setup for a demo robot arm in RViz. Use the interactive markers to drag the end-effector to a new pose and visualize the planned trajectory.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now understand the fundamental concepts behind controlling robot arms and manipulators. You are ready to start building applications that can interact with the world in a more sophisticated way.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Explain what the 'end-effector' of a robot arm is.</li> <li>Describe why the IK problem can have multiple solutions.</li> <li>Use MoveIt to plan and execute a simple trajectory for a robot arm in RViz.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
