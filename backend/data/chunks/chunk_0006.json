Navigate autonomously in a cluttered indoor environment. 2. Perceive objects in its environment. 3. Pick up a specified object. 4. Place the object at a specified location. Project Phases This project is divided into four phases: Phase 1: Robot Design and Simulation In this phase, you will design the URDF model for your humanoid robot and create a Gazebo world for it to live in. Your robot should have at least two arms with grippers, a head with a camera, and a mobile base. Phase 2: Navigation In this phase, you will integrate the Nav2 stack to give your robot the ability to navigate autonomously. You will need to configure the costmaps, planners, and controllers for a humanoid robot. Phase 3: Perception In this phase, you will add a perception system to your robot. This will involve using a pre-trained object detection model to identify objects in the camera feed. Phase 4: Manipulation In this phase, you will use MoveIt to control the robot's arms. You will write a script that uses the output of your perception system to plan and execute a pick-and-place task. <Checkpoint> <p>What are the four main phases of the capstone project?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>This entire project is an exercise! Good luck!</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>Congratulations! You have built",
