The agent takes actions in the environment, and the environment returns a reward and the next state. The agent's goal is to learn a policy (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes the total reward over time. Q-Learning Q-Learning is a classic model-free RL algorithm. It learns a Q-function, which represents the \"quality\" of taking a certain action in a certain state. The Q-function is learned by iteratively updating it based on the rewards received from the environment. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) For problems with a large number of states (like robotics), it's not feasible to store a Q-value for every state-action pair. Deep Q-Networks (DQN) solve this problem by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. The neural network takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for all possible actions. <Checkpoint> <p>In the context of RL, what is a \"policy\"?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Use the OpenAI Gym library to train a simple RL agent to solve the \"CartPole\" problem. Experiment with different hyperparameters (like the learning rate and discount factor) and observe how they affect the agent's performance.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have a foundational understanding of how reinforcement learning can be used to",
