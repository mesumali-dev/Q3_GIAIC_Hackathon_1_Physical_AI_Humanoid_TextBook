  "content_raw": "Glossary This glossary provides definitions for key terms used in this textbook. - Action: In Reinforcement Learning, a decision made by the agent. - Agent: In Reinforcement Learning, the learner or decision-maker. - Costmap: A grid-based representation of the environment used for navigation, where each cell has a value representing the \"cost\" of traveling through it. - D Lite: An incremental search algorithm used for path planning in dynamic environments. - Domain Randomization: A technique for Sim2Real transfer that involves randomizing the parameters of the simulation to make the learned policy more robust. - Embodied Intelligence: The idea that intelligence is deeply intertwined with physical experience. - End-Effector: The hand, gripper, or tool at the end of a robot arm. - Environment: In Reinforcement Learning, the world that the agent interacts with. - Exploration: The task of autonomously exploring an unknown environment to build a map. - Forward Kinematics (FK): The problem of calculating the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles of a robot arm. - Gazebo: A 3D robotics simulator. - Global Planner: A path planner that creates a long-term plan from the robot's current location to a goal. - Grasping: The act of picking up an object with a robot's gripper. - Gripper: The device at the end of a robot arm used for grasping objects. - Grounding Problem: The problem of connecting the symbols of language to the real world. - Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): A field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. - IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): A sensor that measures a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. - Inverse Kinematics (IK): The problem of calculating the required joint angles to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector. - Joint: A connection between two links in a robot that allows for motion. - LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging): A sensor that measures distances by emitting laser beams. - Link: A rigid part of a robot. - Local Planner: A path planner that is responsible for executing a global plan while reacting to immediate obstacles. - Localization: The problem of determining a robot's position in the world. - Long-Term Autonomy: The ability of a robot to operate for extended periods of time without",
