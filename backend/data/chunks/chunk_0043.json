Your docs now have 2 versions: - 1.0 at http://localhost:3000/docs/ for the version 1.0 docs - current at http://localhost:3000/docs/next/ for the upcoming, unreleased docs Add a Version Dropdown To navigate seamlessly across versions, add a version dropdown. Modify the docusaurus.config.js file: The docs version dropdown appears in your navbar: !Docs Version Dropdown Update an existing version It is possible to edit versioned docs in their respective folder: - versioned_docs/version-1.0/hello.md updates http://localhost:3000/docs/hello - docs/hello.md updates http://localhost:3000/docs/next/hello",
