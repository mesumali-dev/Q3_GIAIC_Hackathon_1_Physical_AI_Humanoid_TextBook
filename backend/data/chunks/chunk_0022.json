Algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's algorithm are common choices for global planners. - Local Planning: The local planner is responsible for executing the global plan while reacting to immediate obstacles that may not have been in the original map (e.g., people walking by). The local planner generates velocity commands to keep the robot on the global path while avoiding collisions. Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Local planners use a costmap, which is a grid that represents the robot's immediate surroundings. The costmap is updated in real-time using sensor data. Cells in the costmap are assigned a value representing their \"cost\". Obstacles have a very high cost, and areas near obstacles have a moderate cost. The local planner then chooses velocity commands that will move the robot along the global path while minimizing the cost it travels through. The D* Lite Algorithm For environments that change over time, algorithms like D Lite are very effective. D Lite is an incremental search algorithm that can efficiently replan a path when new information about the environment becomes available, without having to replan from scratch. <Checkpoint> <p>Why is it useful to separate navigation into global and local planning?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Experiment with the Nav2 stack in Gazebo.
