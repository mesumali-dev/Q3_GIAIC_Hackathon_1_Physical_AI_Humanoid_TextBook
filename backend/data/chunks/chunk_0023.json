  "content_raw": "can efficiently replan a path when new information about the environment becomes available, without having to replan from scratch. <Checkpoint> <p>Why is it useful to separate navigation into global and local planning?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Experiment with the Nav2 stack in Gazebo. Place dynamic obstacles in front of the robot while it is navigating to a goal. Observe how the local planner adjusts the robot's path to avoid the obstacles. Try changing the parameters of the local planner to make the robot more or less cautious.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have a deeper understanding of the algorithms and techniques that enable robots to navigate safely and efficiently in the real world.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Explain the difference between a global and a local planner.</li> <li>Describe how a costmap is used for path planning.</li> <li>Tune the parameters of a local planner to change a robot's obstacle avoidance behavior.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
