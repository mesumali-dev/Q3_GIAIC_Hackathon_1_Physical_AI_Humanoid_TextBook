Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. As robots move from factory floors into our homes, offices, and hospitals, it is crucial that they are designed to be safe, intuitive, and effective to interact with. Modes of Interaction Humans can interact with robots in many different ways: - Remote Control: The human directly controls the robot's actions from a distance (teleoperation). - Supervisory Control: The human provides high-level commands to the robot, and the robot executes them autonomously. - Collaborative Control: The human and robot work together on a shared task, often in a shared workspace. - Social Interaction: The robot interacts with humans using social cues, such as speech, gestures, and facial expressions. Safety in HRI Safety is the most important consideration in HRI. When humans and robots share a workspace, there is always a risk of injury. HRI researchers and engineers have developed a variety of techniques to ensure safety, including: - Collision Avoidance: Using sensors to detect humans and avoid collisions. - Force Limiting: Designing robots that can only exert a limited amount of force, so they cannot injure a person even if a collision occurs. - Predictive Models: Using models of human behavior to predict a person's future movements and avoid potential collisions. <Checkpoint> <p>What is the difference between supervisory control and collaborative control?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Think of a task",
