  "content_raw": ": - Costmaps: Representations of the environment where each cell has a value corresponding to its \"cost\" to travel through. Obstacles have a high cost. - Planners: Algorithms that find a path from the robot's current position to the goal. - Controllers: Algorithms that follow the planned path while reacting to immediate obstacles. <Checkpoint> <p>Why is SLAM considered a \"chicken and egg\" problem?</p> </Checkpoint> <Exercise> <p>Explore the Nav2 documentation. Run the Nav2 getting started example and send a navigation goal to the simulated robot in RViz2.</p> </Exercise> <Outcome> <p>You now have a conceptual framework for understanding the complex topic of robot navigation. You are ready to dive deeper into the specific algorithms and tools used to make robots navigate autonomously.</p> </Outcome> <SuccessCriteria> <ul> <li>Explain the difference between localization and mapping.</li> <li>Describe the inputs and outputs of a SLAM algorithm.</li> <li>List the main components of the Nav2 stack.</li> </ul> </SuccessCriteria>",
