Perception: Identify the object to be picked up and determine its pose (position and orientation). 2. Planning (Approach): Plan a collision-free path for the gripper to approach the object. 3. Grasping: Close the gripper to grasp the object. 4. Planning (Lift): Plan a path to lift the object. 5. Planning (Move): Plan a path to move the object to the desired place location. 6. Placing: Open the gripper to release the object. 7. Planning (Retreat): Plan a path to move the arm back to a home position. Gripper Types The gripper (or end-effector) is the part of the robot that physically interacts with the object. There are many different types of grippers, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Two common types are: - Parallel-Jaw Grippers: These grippers have two fingers that move in parallel to grasp an object. They are simple and effective for a wide range of objects. - Suction Grippers: These grippers use vacuum to pick up objects. They are particularly well-suited for flat, smooth surfaces. Grasp Planning Grasp planning is the problem of determining how to position the gripper to achieve a stable grasp on an object. This is a complex problem that depends on the geometry of the object, the properties of the gripper, and the task to",
