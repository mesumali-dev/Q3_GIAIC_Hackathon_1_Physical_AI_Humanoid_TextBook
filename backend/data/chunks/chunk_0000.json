  "content_raw": "Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Welcome to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This textbook will guide you through the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques required to understand, build, and simulate intelligent robots that can interact with the physical world. What is Physical AI? Physical AI is a field of artificial intelligence focused on creating agents that can perceive, reason about, and interact with their physical environment. Unlike purely digital AI (like chatbots or game-playing AI), Physical AI is embodied, meaning it exists within a physical system, such as a robot. This embodiment brings a unique set of challenges and opportunities, as the AI must deal with the complexities and uncertainties of the real world, such as physics, sensor noise, and unexpected events. The Rise of Humanoid Robotics Humanoid robotics is a subfield of robotics focused on creating robots with a human-like form and capabilities. The humanoid form factor is particularly interesting because our world is designed for humans. A robot that can navigate stairs, open doors, and use human tools has the potential to seamlessly integrate into our society and assist with a wide range of tasks. Embodied Intelligence Embodied Intelligence is the core concept that connects Physical AI and humanoid robotics. It is the idea that intelligence is not just about abstract reasoning but is deeply intertwined with physical experience. An embodied agent learns and understands the world through its physical interactions. For example, it learns about gravity by experiencing its effects, and it learns how to grasp an object by trying, failing, and succeeding. Course Objectives This textbook is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. By the end of this course, you will be able to: - Understand the fundamental principles of robotics, including kinematics, dynamics, and control. - Model and simulate humanoid robots in realistic environments using industry-standard tools. - Implement perception algorithms to enable robots to \"see\" and understand their surroundings. - Apply machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning, to train intelligent robot behaviors. - Integrate various components to build a complete, autonomous humanoid robot in simulation. Introduction to Tools Throughout this textbook, we will use a variety of powerful software tools to design, simulate, and program our robots. Here are some of the key tools you will become familiar with: - Docusaurus: The framework this textbook is built on. It allows for the creation of beautiful and interactive documentation websites. - Robot Operating System (ROS 2): The standard open-source framework for robotics software",
