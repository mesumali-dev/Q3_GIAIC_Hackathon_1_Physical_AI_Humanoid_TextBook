This is the \"easy\" problem.\n-   **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** If you want the end-effector to be at a specific position and orientation, what are the required angles for each of the joints? This is the \"hard\" problem.\n\nThe IK problem is more difficult because it often has multiple solutions (or no solution at all). For example, you can touch your nose with your elbow pointing up or down. These are two different solutions to the IK problem for your arm.\n\n## MoveIt: The Motion Planning Framework\n\n**MoveIt** is a powerful and widely used motion planning framework for ROS. It takes the complexity out of IK and motion planning, allowing you to command a robot arm to move to a specific pose without having to solve the IK problem yourself.\n\nMoveIt provides a set of tools for:\n\n-   **Inverse Kinematics:** Finding joint configurations for a desired end-effector pose.\n-   **Motion Planning:** Finding a collision-free path for the arm to move from its current configuration to a goal configuration.\n-   **3D Perception:** Using sensor data to build a representation of the environment for collision avoidance.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>Why is Inverse Kinematics considered a \"hard\" problem compared to Forward Kinematics?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Work through the MoveIt tutorials.
