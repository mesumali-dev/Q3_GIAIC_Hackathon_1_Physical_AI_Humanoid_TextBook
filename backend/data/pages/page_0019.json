This introduces a new set of challenges, including:\n\n-   **Life-long mapping:** How can a robot update its map as the environment changes over time?\n-   **Localization recovery:** How can a robot recover its position if it gets lost?\n-   **Battery management:** How can a robot ensure that it always has enough power to complete its tasks and return to a charging station?\n\n## Multi-Robot Coordination\n\nFor tasks that are too large or complex for a single robot, a team of robots can be used. **Multi-robot coordination** is the problem of getting a team of robots to work together effectively. There are two main approaches:\n\n-   **Centralized:** A central server makes all the decisions for the team. This is simple to implement but can be a single point of failure.\n-   **Decentralized:** Each robot makes its own decisions based on local information and communication with its neighbors. This is more robust but can be more difficult to design and analyze.\n\n## Exploration\n\n**Exploration** is the task of autonomously exploring an unknown environment to build a map. The goal is to choose a sequence of actions that will reveal the most information about the environment in the least amount of time. This is often framed as a \"next-best-view\" problem, where the robot must decide where to go next to see the most new territory.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the main advantage of a decentralized approach to multi-robot coordination?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Read about the different exploration algorithms available in the Nav2 stack.
