A simulator like Gazebo provides a virtual environment where you can safely and rapidly test your robot's software. Gazebo simulates physics, sensors, and actuators, allowing you to develop your code as if it were running on a real robot.\n\n## The Gazebo World\n\nA Gazebo simulation takes place in a **world**, which is defined in an SDF file. The world file specifies the environment, including:\n\n-   **Models:** Robots, furniture, and other objects.\n-   **Physics:** Gravity, friction, and other physical properties.\n-   **Lighting:** Light sources to illuminate the scene.\n-   **Sensors:** Simulated cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, etc.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A(World.sdf) --> B{Physics Engine};\n    A --> C{Models};\n    C --> D(Robot 1);\n    C --> E(Table);\n    A --> F{Lighting};\n    A --> G{Sensors};\n```\n\n## Interfacing with ROS 2\n\nGazebo integrates seamlessly with ROS 2 through a set of plugins. These plugins expose the simulator's functionality through standard ROS 2 topics, services, and actions. For example, you can control a simulated robot's joints by publishing messages to a ROS 2 topic, and you can receive simulated sensor data from another topic.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is a \"world\" file in Gazebo, and what does it typically define?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Launch an empty Gazebo world.
