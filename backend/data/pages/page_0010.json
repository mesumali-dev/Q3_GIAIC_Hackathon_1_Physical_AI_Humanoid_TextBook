These plugins generate sensor data based on the state of the simulated world and publish it to ROS 2 topics. To add a sensor to your robot, you need to add a `<sensor>` block to your URDF or SDF file and configure the appropriate plugin.\n\n## Camera\n\nA camera sensor simulates a real-world camera, publishing images to a ROS 2 topic. You can configure the camera's resolution, frame rate, and other parameters. The `gazebo_ros_camera` plugin is commonly used for this.\n\n## LiDAR\n\nA LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor measures distances by emitting laser beams. In Gazebo, a LiDAR sensor plugin simulates this by casting rays into the environment and calculating the distances to objects. The data is typically published as a `sensor_msgs/msg/LaserScan` or `sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2` message.\n\n## IMU\n\nAn IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measures a robot's orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration. A Gazebo IMU plugin simulates the readings of a real IMU, often with configurable noise models to make the simulation more realistic.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the role of a Gazebo plugin in sensor simulation?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Add a camera sensor to the front of your simulated robot's chassis.
