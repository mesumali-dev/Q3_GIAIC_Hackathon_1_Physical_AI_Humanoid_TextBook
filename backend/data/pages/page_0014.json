The agent takes **actions** in the environment, and the environment returns a **reward** and the next **state**. The agent's goal is to learn a **policy** (a mapping from states to actions) that maximizes the total reward over time.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph RL Loop\n        A(Agent) -- Action --> B(Environment);\n        B -- Reward & New State --> A;\n    end\n```\n\n## Q-Learning\n\n**Q-Learning** is a classic model-free RL algorithm. It learns a **Q-function**, which represents the \"quality\" of taking a certain action in a certain state. The Q-function is learned by iteratively updating it based on the rewards received from the environment.\n\n## Deep Q-Networks (DQN)\n\nFor problems with a large number of states (like robotics), it's not feasible to store a Q-value for every state-action pair. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** solve this problem by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function. The neural network takes the state as input and outputs the Q-values for all possible actions.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>In the context of RL, what is a \"policy\"?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Use the OpenAI Gym library to train a simple RL agent to solve the \"CartPole\" problem. Experiment with different hyperparameters (like the learning rate and discount factor) and observe how they affect the agent's performance.</p>\n</Exercise>\n\n<Outcome>\n  <p>You now have a foundational understanding of how reinforcement learning can be used to train intelligent agents. You are ready to explore how these techniques can be applied to more complex robotics problems.</p>\n</Outcome>\n\n<SuccessCriteria>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Define the five core components of an RL problem.</li>\n    <li>Explain the purpose of a reward function.</li>\n    <li>Describe a robotics problem that could be solved using RL.</li>\n  </ul>\n</SuccessCriteria>\n",
