You should add `source /opt/ros/<distro>/setup.bash` to your `~/.bashrc` file (replace `<distro>` with your ROS 2 distribution, e.g., `humble`).\n\n## Gazebo Issues\n\n-   **Problem:** Gazebo is running very slowly.\n    -   **Solution:** Gazebo can be computationally intensive. Make sure you are running it on a computer with a dedicated graphics card. You can also try reducing the `real_time_update_rate` in your world file.\n-   **Problem:** My robot model falls through the floor in Gazebo.\n    -   **Solution:** This is usually caused by incorrect collision geometry in your URDF/SDF file. Make sure that all the links in your model have a `<collision>` tag with valid geometry.\n\n## Nav2 Issues\n\n-   **Problem:** The robot is not moving when I send a navigation goal.\n    -   **Solution:** There are many possible causes for this. Check the following:\n        -   Is the Nav2 stack running correctly?\n        -   Is the robot localized correctly in the map?\n        -   Is there a valid path from the robot's current position to the goal?\n        -   Are the costmap parameters configured correctly?\n\n## MoveIt Issues\n\n-   **Problem:** MoveIt is unable to find an IK solution.\n    -   **Solution:** This can happen if the desired pose is unreachable or if the IK solver is not configured correctly. Try moving the goal pose to a different location. You can also try a different IK solver.\n",
