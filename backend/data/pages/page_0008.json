In ROS 2, this is typically done by running a teleoperation node that reads input from a keyboard, joystick, or other device and publishes velocity commands to a topic.\n\nThe standard topic for velocity commands is `/cmd_vel`, and the message type is `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`. A `Twist` message contains two vectors: `linear` (for x, y, z velocity) and `angular` (for roll, pitch, yaw velocity).\n\n## Simple Autonomous Movement\n\nTo make a robot move on its own, you can write a ROS 2 node that publishes `Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic. By controlling the linear and angular velocities over time, you can make the robot follow a specific path.\n\nFor example, to make a robot drive in a straight line, you would publish a `Twist` message with a constant positive `linear.x` value and zero for all other values. To make it turn, you would publish a message with a positive or negative `angular.z` value.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the name and message type of the standard ROS 2 topic for robot velocity commands?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Write a ROS 2 Python node that makes your simulated robot drive in a circle.
