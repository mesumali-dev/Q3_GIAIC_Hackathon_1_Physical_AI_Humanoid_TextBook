For example, a perception system might take an image from a camera and identify the location of all the chairs in the image.\n\n## Object Detection\n\n**Object detection** is a computer vision task that involves identifying the presence and location of objects in an image. The output of an object detection algorithm is typically a list of bounding boxes, where each box encloses an object and is associated with a class label (e.g., \"person\", \"car\", \"chair\").\n\n## Semantic Segmentation\n\n**Semantic segmentation** is a more detailed perception task. Instead of just drawing a bounding box around an object, semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every single pixel in the image. This provides a much richer understanding of the scene, as it delineates the exact shape of each object.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the key difference in the output of an object detection algorithm versus a semantic segmentation algorithm?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Find a pre-trained object detection model (such as YOLO or SSD) and a corresponding ROS 2 wrapper.
