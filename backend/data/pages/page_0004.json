Navigate autonomously in a cluttered indoor environment.\n2.  Perceive objects in its environment.\n3.  Pick up a specified object.\n4.  Place the object at a specified location.\n\n## Project Phases\n\nThis project is divided into four phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Robot Design and Simulation\n\nIn this phase, you will design the URDF model for your humanoid robot and create a Gazebo world for it to live in. Your robot should have at least two arms with grippers, a head with a camera, and a mobile base.\n\n### Phase 2: Navigation\n\nIn this phase, you will integrate the Nav2 stack to give your robot the ability to navigate autonomously. You will need to configure the costmaps, planners, and controllers for a humanoid robot.\n\n### Phase 3: Perception\n\nIn this phase, you will add a perception system to your robot. This will involve using a pre-trained object detection model to identify objects in the camera feed.\n\n### Phase 4: Manipulation\n\nIn this phase, you will use MoveIt to control the robot's arms. You will write a script that uses the output of your perception system to plan and execute a pick-and-place task.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What are the four main phases of the capstone project?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>This entire project is an exercise!
