It doesn't have a map, and it doesn't know its location. **SLAM** is a set of algorithms that allows a robot to build a map of its environment while simultaneously tracking its own position within that map. This is a classic \"chicken and egg\" problem in robotics, and it is fundamental to autonomous navigation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph SLAM Algorithm\n        A(Sensor Data) --> B{Mapping};\n        B --> C{Map};\n        A --> D{Localization};\n        D --> E(Robot Pose);\n        C -.-> D;\n        E -.-> B;\n    end\n```\n\n## The Nav2 Stack\n\n**Nav2** is the official navigation stack in ROS 2. It is a powerful and flexible system that provides a complete solution for autonomous navigation. Nav2 takes in sensor data, a map, and a goal, and it outputs velocity commands to move the robot to the goal while avoiding obstacles.\n\nKey components of Nav2 include:\n\n-   **Costmaps:** Representations of the environment where each cell has a value corresponding to its \"cost\" to travel through. Obstacles have a high cost.\n-   **Planners:** Algorithms that find a path from the robot's current position to the goal.\n-   **Controllers:** Algorithms that follow the planned path while reacting to immediate obstacles.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>Why is SLAM considered a \"chicken and egg\" problem?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Explore the Nav2 documentation.
