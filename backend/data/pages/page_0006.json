A robot model defines the robot's structure, including its links, joints, sensors, and visual appearance.\n\n## URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)\n\n**URDF** is an XML-based format used in ROS to describe the kinematics and dynamics of a robot. It represents the robot as a tree of **links** connected by **joints**.\n\n-   **Links:** These are the rigid parts of the robot (e.g., the chassis, a wheel, an arm segment).\n-   **Joints:** These define the motion between links. Common joint types include `revolute` (for rotating joints), `continuous` (for wheels), and `prismatic` (for sliding joints).\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A(base_link) -->|chassis_to_left_wheel_joint| B(left_wheel_link);\n    A -->|chassis_to_right_wheel_joint| C(right_wheel_link);\n```\n\n## SDF (Simulation Description Format)\n\n**SDF** is another XML-based format, primarily used by the Gazebo simulator. While URDF is great for describing the kinematics of a single robot, SDF is a more comprehensive format that can describe an entire simulation world, including multiple robots, lighting, physics, and sensors.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>When would you choose to use SDF over URDF?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Create a simple URDF file for a robot with a single arm that rotates at the shoulder.
