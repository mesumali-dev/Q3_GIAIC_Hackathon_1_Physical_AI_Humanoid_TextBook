Each node should be responsible for a single, well-defined task, such as controlling a wheel, reading a sensor, or planning a path.\n\n### Topics\n\n**Topics** are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They use a publish-subscribe communication pattern. A node can **publish** messages to a topic, and any number of other nodes can **subscribe** to that topic to receive the messages. This is a one-to-many communication mechanism.\n\n### Services\n\n**Services** are used for request-response communication. A node can offer a **service**, and another node can act as a **client** to send a request and wait for a response. This is a one-to-one communication mechanism, suitable for tasks that require a direct confirmation, like \"get the robot's current position.\"\n\n### Actions\n\n**Actions** are used for long-running tasks that provide feedback. They are similar to services but are designed for tasks that might take a significant amount of time to complete, such as navigating to a goal. An action client can send a goal to an action server, receive feedback on the progress of the goal, and get a final result.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the main difference between a ROS 2 topic and a service?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Follow the official ROS 2 documentation to install ROS 2 and run the \"turtlesim\" simulator.

This graph structure allows for modular and scalable robotics applications. Nodes A node is the smallest unit of execution in ROS 2. Each node should be responsible for a single, well-defined task, such as controlling a wheel, reading a sensor, or planning a path. Topics Topics are named buses over which nodes exchange messages. They use a publish-subscribe communication pattern. A node can publish messages to a topic, and any number of other nodes can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. This is a one-to-many communication mechanism. Services Services are used for request-response communication. A node can offer a service, and another node can act as a client to send a request and wait for a response. This is a one-to-one communication mechanism, suitable for tasks that require a direct confirmation, like \"get the robot's current position.\" Actions Actions are used for long-running tasks that provide feedback.
