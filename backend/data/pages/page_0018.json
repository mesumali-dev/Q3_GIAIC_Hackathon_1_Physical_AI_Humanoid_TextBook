Two common types are:\n\n-   **Parallel-Jaw Grippers:** These grippers have two fingers that move in parallel to grasp an object. They are simple and effective for a wide range of objects.\n-   **Suction Grippers:** These grippers use vacuum to pick up objects. They are particularly well-suited for flat, smooth surfaces.\n\n## Grasp Planning\n\n**Grasp planning** is the problem of determining how to position the gripper to achieve a stable grasp on an object. This is a complex problem that depends on the geometry of the object, the properties of the gripper, and the task to be performed.
