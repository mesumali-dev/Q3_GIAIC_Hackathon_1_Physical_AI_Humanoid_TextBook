When humans and robots share a workspace, there is always a risk of injury. HRI researchers and engineers have developed a variety of techniques to ensure safety, including:\n\n-   **Collision Avoidance:** Using sensors to detect humans and avoid collisions.\n-   **Force Limiting:** Designing robots that can only exert a limited amount of force, so they cannot injure a person even if a collision occurs.\n-   **Predictive Models:** Using models of human behavior to predict a person's future movements and avoid potential collisions.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the difference between supervisory control and collaborative control?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Think of a task that you do every day that could be made easier with the help of a robot.
