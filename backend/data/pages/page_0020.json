This often involves cross-compiling your code for a different architecture (e.g., ARM) and setting up the robot's operating system with the necessary dependencies.\n\n## Launch Files\n\nA complex ROS 2 application can consist of dozens of nodes, each with its own set of parameters. Starting all of these nodes manually would be tedious and error-prone. **Launch files** are Python scripts that allow you to start and configure a complete ROS 2 system with a single command.\n\nWith launch files, you can:\n\n-   Start multiple nodes.\n-   Set parameters for each node.\n-   Remap topic names.\n-   Group nodes into namespaces.\n\n## Debugging and Logging\n\nWhen things go wrong on a real robot, it can be difficult to figure out what happened. ROS 2 provides a number of tools to help with debugging and logging:\n\n-   **`ros2 bag`:** A command-line tool for recording and replaying data from a running ROS 2 system. This is incredibly useful for capturing data from a failed experiment and replaying it in a simulator to debug the problem.\n-   **`rqt_console`:** A GUI tool for viewing and filtering log messages from all the nodes in the system.\n\n<Checkpoint>\n  <p>What is the purpose of a ROS 2 launch file?</p>\n</Checkpoint>\n\n<Exercise>\n  <p>Create a ROS 2 package that contains two nodes: a talker and a listener. Write a launch file that starts both nodes and remaps the topic they use to communicate.

Launch Files A complex ROS 2 application can consist of dozens of nodes, each with its own set of parameters. Starting all of these nodes manually would be tedious and error-prone. Launch files are Python scripts that allow you to start and configure a complete ROS 2 system with a single command. With launch files, you can: - Start multiple nodes. - Set parameters for each node. - Remap topic names. - Group nodes into namespaces. Debugging and Logging When things go wrong on a real robot, it can be difficult to figure out what happened. ROS 2 provides a number of tools to help with debugging and logging: - ros2 bag: A command-line tool for recording and replaying data from a running ROS 2 system.
